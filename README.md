ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PabloRodriguezRomero

I'm a Civil Engineer recently interested in cloud infrastructure over the AWS environment!. I'm currently learning some CCNA courses after having my AWS Solution
Architect-Associate certification and AWS-CCP.

I'm looking to get into the AWS TechU program or an AWS Partner newgrad program either!
